    <!-- Chosen Palette: Professional Calm -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a narrative journey through Hossam's career. It starts with a high-level summary and key impact metrics (dashboard) for quick assessment by busy recruiters. An interactive timeline then provides a chronological overview, allowing users to click and deep-dive into specific roles. The extensive Google experience is organized into tabs for clarity. Key achievements are presented with text and bolding to make data digestible and memorable. This structure guides the user from a broad overview to specific details in an engaging, non-linear way, which is more effective than a static document for showcasing impact and expertise. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
    - Report Info: Key career achievements (cost savings, efficiency gains). Goal: Inform/Impress. Viz/Method: Large number "Stat Cards". Interaction: Subtle hover effects. Justification: Grabs immediate attention and highlights quantifiable success. Method: HTML/Tailwind.
    - Report Info: Career history. Goal: Change/Organize. Viz/Method: Interactive vertical timeline. Interaction: On click, reveals detailed role descriptions below. Justification: Provides a clear, engaging overview of career progression. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
    - Report Info: Detailed roles at Google. Goal: Organize. Viz/Method: Tabbed content area. Interaction: Click tabs to switch between role details. Justification: Manages a large amount of related information cleanly without cluttering the page. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
    - Report Info: Handover process time reduction and forecast accuracy. Goal: Inform/Compare. Viz/Method: Text blocks with bolded numbers. Interaction: None. Justification: Clearly communicates key metrics without a visual chart, keeping the page minimal while still highlighting the achievements. Method: HTML/Tailwind.
    - Report Info: Skills & Certifications. Goal: Inform. Viz/Method: Grid layout with icons. Interaction: None. Justification: Clean, scannable presentation of qualifications. Method: HTML/Tailwind.
